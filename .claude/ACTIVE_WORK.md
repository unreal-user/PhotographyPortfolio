## 📋 Session Notes

- Repository already has good foundation:
  - Frontend: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite with routing and core components
  - Infrastructure: Terraform Phase 0 complete (state backend ready)
  - Sample data and basic styling in place

- Need to be mindful of tmpfs environment - commit frequently!

## 💡 Ideas / Future Considerations

- Consider adding pre-commit hooks for linting/formatting
- May want to add a CHANGELOG.md for tracking releases
- Consider GitHub Actions for automated deployments
- May want environment-specific configs (.env files)

- Update this file at the start and end of each work session
